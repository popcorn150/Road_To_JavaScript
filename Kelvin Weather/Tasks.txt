> The forecast today is 293 Kelvin. To start, create a variable named kelvin, 
and set it equal to 293. The value saved to kelvin will stay constant. 
Choose the variable type with this in mind.

> Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

> Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees 
less than Kelvin. Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273 
from the kelvin variable. Store the result in another variable, named celsius.

> Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

> Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a variable named fahrenheit.
Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32
In the next step we will round the number saved to fahrenheit. 
Choose the variable type that allows you to change its value.

> Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

> When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal number.
Use the .floor() method from the built-in Math object to round down the Fahrenheit temperature. 
Save the result to the fahrenheit variable.

> Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

> Use console.log and string interpolation to log the temperature 
in fahrenheit to the console as follows: The temperature is TEMPERATURE degrees Fahrenheit.
Use string interpolation to replace TEMPERATURE with the value saved to fahrenheit.

> Great work! Kelvin can now publish his forecasts in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

> If you’d like extra practice, try this:
- Convert celsius to the Newton scale using the equation below
    Newton = Celsius * (33/100)
- Round down the Newton temperature using the .floor() method
- Use console.log and string interpolation to log the temperature in newton to the console
