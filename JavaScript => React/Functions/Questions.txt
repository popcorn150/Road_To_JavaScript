<<- Functions ->>
|--> Function Parameters: Write a function called sum that takes an arbitrary number of arguments 
and returns the sum of all the arguments. <--|

|--> Function Scope: Write a function called outerFunction that declares a variable 
x with a value of 5. Inside outerFunction, declare another function called innerFunction that multiplies x by 2. 
Call innerFunction from within outerFunction and return the result. <--|

|--> Function Expressions: Write a function expression called multiply that takes two parameters, 
a and b, and returns the product of a and b. <--|

|--> Recursion: Write a recursive function called factorial that takes a number n as input 
and returns the factorial of n (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to n). <--|

|--> Callback Functions: Write a function called calculate that takes two numbers 
and a callback function as parameters. The callback function should perform a 
mathematical operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
on the two numbers and return the result. <--|

|--> Higher-Order Functions: Write a function called applyOperation that takes 
two numbers and a callback function as parameters. The callback function 
should define a mathematical operation (e.g., square, cube, square root) 
and apply it to one of the numbers. <--|

|--> Function Context: Write an object called calculator with methods add, subtract, 
multiply, and divide, each taking two parameters and returning 
the result of the respective operation. <--|
